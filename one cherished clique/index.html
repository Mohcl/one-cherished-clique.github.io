                <h2>The earth is art <br>The photography is only the witness.</h2>
                <p>Photography has evolved a billion times since the camera was invented. It not only gave people the opportunity to click the
                     pictures and save them for the future, but also provided a kind of platform to express their emotions, feelings, and
                      perception. A human being able to use the brain for seeing and observing has made the camera a tool, to express the 
                      unspoken words and sentences to the outside world. A man's word and photographs have the unimaginable untapped power.
                      <br>

                    In the series of evolution now photographers not only click and save pictures for themselves but can share photos with the 
                    outside world. There are a number of photography clubs who give a platform to all budding and professional photographs to 
                    upload photos free of cost and get recognition, popularity, and remuneration too.
